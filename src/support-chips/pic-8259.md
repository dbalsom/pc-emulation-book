# Intel 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller

The Intel 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) is essential for the operation of much of the hardware of the IBM PC. The PIC can be thought of as an expansion unit to the 8088's single INTR line, allowing 8 separate interrupt sources to be handled in a prioritized manner.

The PIC is a surprisingly challenging chip to emulate correctly, partially due to some ambiguities in its documentation.

## Basic Operation

The 8 inputs of the 8259 are called Interrupt Request lines, which are often referred to as `IRQ`s (**I**nterrupt **r**e**Q**uest).

The 8259 has three main 8-bit registers, with each bit corresponding to an IRQ.
 - **Interrupt Request Register:** This register holds bits reflecting the IRQ lines that are requesting service.
 - **Interrupt Mask Register:** A `1` bit set in this register prevents the corresponding IRQ line from being serviced.
 - **In-Service Register:** A `1` bit set in this register indicates that the corresponding IRQ has been acknowledged by the CPU and is now "in-service".

The 8 IRQs in the 8259 are ordered in terms of **priority**, with IRQ 0 being the highest priority, and IRQ 7 being the lowest priority. This means that if IRQ 0 and IRQ 1 occur simultaneously, IRQ 0 will be serviced first. There are ways to alter this behavior, but the IBM PC does not configure the 8259 to do so.

## The Unimportant Stuff

The 8259 was designed to be compatible not only with the 8088 and 8086, but with Intel's earlier CPU, the 8080. There are various mode flag bits that control whether the 8259 should expect to be paired with an 8088 or not - obviously, on the IBM PC, you can expect these bits to be set properly, and emulation of the 8080 modes is certainly not required.

In addition, the 8259 supported daisy-chaining of additional 8259 chips to enable more interrupt sources to be handled - something that Intel called **cascading**. This was not used on the IBM PC, which only had a single 8259. Two 8259s were employed on the IBM 5170 AT in a primary/secondary configuration. Obviously this is something you do not need to emulate either.

The 8259 can be operated in **edge-triggered** or **level-triggered** mode. The IBM PC exclusively operates in edge-triggered mode, but implementing level-triggered mode is fairly trivial to do. 

There are additional features like **priority rotation** or **special mask mode** which are not used by the IBM PC.

### Interrupt Processing Logic

The important thing to understand about the 8259 is that it is implemented as an array of 8 **priority cell** circuits. The `IRR`, `IMR`, and `ISR` "registers" are simply latches within each priority cell. This means that a good part of the interrupt evaluation logic happens continuously, since it is simply a result of the circuit state at a given time. The 8259 has no clock input, so all it can do is respond to changes of its input pins. With one exception - but we'll talk about that later.

Let's look at an example of logic flow:

#### The Simple Version

1) A device raises its IRQ line connected to the 8259.
2) The 8259 looks to see if that IRQ is masked off in the IMR, if it is already in service, or if a higher-priority interrupt is in service, in which case the interrupt cannot be serviced at the moment.
3) If the IRQ can be serviced, the 8259 raises the INTR line to the CPU.
4) The CPU acknowledges the interrupt, and the 8259 sets the corresponding bit in the ISR to indicate that the interrupt is now in service. The corresponding bit in the IRR is cleared to indicate the interrupt is no longer requesting service.
5) The CPU executes the interrupt based on the 8-bit vector the 8259 provides in response to the CPU's interrupt acknowledgement.
6) The interrupt service routine executes. When it is done, it sends an `End-of-Interrupt (EOI)` command to the 8259.
7) The 8259 clears the corresponding bit in the `ISR` indicating that the interrupt has completed servicing.

The original IRQ line may remain high at this point, but in the PC's standard edge-triggered mode it will not be serviced again until it transitions low and then high again.

#### The Detailed Version

1) A device raises its IRQ line connected to the 8259.
2) The low-to-high transition of the IRQ line sets the IRQ's **edge latch** and sets the corresponding bit in the `IRR`.
    1) If the corresponding bit in the `IMR` is set, the signal from the `IRR` does not propagate further.
    2) If the corresponding bit in the `IMR` is clear, the signal from the `IRR` reaches the `Priority Resolver`.
3) The priority resolver checks to see if the corresponding bit in the `ISR` is set, or if any bits *lower* than the corresponding bit are set, indicating a higher priority interrupt is already in service.
    1) If any of these bits are set, nothing further happens for the moment.
    2) If none of these bits are set, the priority resolver will instruct the **control logic** to raise the 8259's INTR pin, which is connected to the CPU.
4) The CPU finishes an instruction, at which point it samples the INTR pin.
5) The CPU notices INTR is high.
    1) If the CPU's `I` flag is cleared, it ignores INTR being high and continues execution as normal.
6) The CPU begins to acknowledge the interrupt.
    1) The CPU issues one bus cycle with the `INTA` bus status encoded.
    2) The CPU bus controller decodes the `INTA` bus status and asserts the physical \\(\overline{INTA}\\) pin.
7) The 8259 detects the \\(\overline{INTA}\\) pin going high.
    1) The priority resolver sets the highest-priority bit in the `ISR` to indicate that the interrupt is entering service.
    2) **In edge-triggered mode**, the priority resolver clears the corresponding bit in the `IRR`. 
      - This is the only difference between edge-triggered mode and level-triggered mode.
    3) The **control logic** asserts the internal \\(\overline{FREEZE}\\) signal. This prevents any change to any bit in the `IRR` while the interrupt acknowledge process is active.
8) The \\(\overline{INTA}\\) pin goes low as the CPU completes the INTA bus cycle.
9) The \\(\overline{INTA}\\) pin goes high again as the CPU issues a second INTA bus cycle.
10) The 8259 emits the 8-bit **interrupt vector** which the CPU reads during the second INTA bus cycle.
11) The \\(\overline{INTA}\\) pin goes low as the CPU completes the second INTA bus cycle.
    1) The **control logic** de-asserts the \\(\overline{FREEZE}\\) signal, allowing the `IRR` to update again.
    2) **In auto-EOI** mode, the priority resolver clears the corresponding `ISR` bit.
12) The CPU uses the interrupt vector received from the 8259 to look up a far pointer to the correct **Interrupt Service Routine** from the **Interrupt Vector Table**.
13) The CPU clears the `I` and `T` flags, then jumps to the interrupt service routine.
14) At the end of the interrupt service routine, the routine sends an `EOI` command to the 8259.
15) The 8259 clears the appropriate bit in the `ISR` to indicate that the interrupt has completed servicing.
